stvdownload
===========

For downloading mp4 files from your Simple TV.

This is a very simply written app using Griffon to download recorded mp4 files from your Simple TV to your computer.  It works much better to run this on the network local to your Simple.TV DVR, though remote downloading is available.

Now supports multiple DVRs!

Very little error reporting is included.  Have patience between button clicks as the Simple TV "webservice" is pretty slow.
